Open Telemetry is all set up to provide data to a visualizer.
During development, we set up SigNoz to show data.
Install it by:

```shell
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

Then go to http://localhost:3301/services/ZAC and see the data coming in.
